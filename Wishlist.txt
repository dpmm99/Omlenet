I'd like to see tags on foods instead of having a 'category' dropdown: 
[existing categories]
red meat
processed meat
animal product (for the vegans out there)
uncommon (because meal plans should be realistic)
expensive
normally not consumed in large quantities (who's going to eat 100g of dried parsley?)
short expiration (<5 days)
long expiration (>3 weeks)
refrigeration required
